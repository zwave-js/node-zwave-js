# Contributing to `node-zwave-js`

First of all, welcome!

We're happy that you're considering helping us out. Although the goal of this project is to be(come) the best Z-Wave driver out there, it is developed in our free time. So every bit of support helps. There are many ways to contribute, but also a few rules to follow, so we can use our precious time to make `node-zwave-js` better instead of wading through issues in GitHub.

## Do you have a problem? Something not working? Configuration missing?

Please read the [troubleshooting](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/troubleshooting/index) section of the documentation. Your problem might already be answered there.
If not, consider opening an issue. Please **use the issue templates** and fill them out as best as you can.

## Do you want to propose a new feature?

Open an issue with the **feature request template** and fill it out. For complicated features or ones that need some brainstorming, you can join us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/zwave2mqtt/shared_invite/enQtNjc4NjgyNjc3NDI2LTc3OGQzYmJlZDIzZTJhMzUzZWQ3M2Q3NThmMjY5MGY1MTc4NjFiOWZhZWE5YjNmNGE0OWRjZjJiMjliZGQyYmU) and discuss there.

## Do you want to contribute device configuration files?

Thanks, just go ahead and open a PR! Please make sure to follow our [standards and contribution guidelines for configuration files](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/config-files/contributing-files).

**Did you know?** ü•≥  
We now have preconfigured [online instances of VSCode](https://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js) that help you through the contributing process without having to download and install a bunch of stuff on your system. These have auto-formatting and let you run checks, so prefer using them over editing on Github.

## Do you want to help out with a PR?

There are several issues labeled with [![](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/help%20wanted)](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). Choose one and start hacking. Just let us know that you're working on it to avoid duplicating work.

If you're new, you might want to choose an issue with ![](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/good%20first%20issue) or <kbd>Effort: low ü§èüèª</kbd> labels. The higher effort labels usually indicate that you need deeper knowledge of the code base (especially <kbd>Effort: huge ‚õ∞</kbd>).

If there is no corresponding issue it might be worth to open one before you start working to make sure that we will accept the PR.

**Note:** We use _conventional commits_ for our commit messages and PR titles.
If you're unsure what that means, check out the [description and examples](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
Since PRs are squash-merged, it is enough to edit the PR title accordingly.

## Do you want to help out with a PR but don't know how stuff works?

Some things are already described in the [Development documentation](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/development/intro). If not, feel free to ask or raise an issue about missing documentation. Time is limited, so it is not always worth documenting every development aspect in depth.
