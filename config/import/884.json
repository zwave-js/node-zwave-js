	"info_overview": "<p>From Dome Home Automation, monitor every door in your house with the window / door sensor PRO, including your mailbox door! The Door/Window PRO magnet is 1/4” wide, and the magnet can be placed up to one inch away from the sensor which means you can place it nearly anywhere to keep track of openings in places you may have never thought possible. Use the Dome Home Automation Z-Wave Door/Window Sensor PRO to secure cabinets, windows, doors and other fixtures you want to keep closed or monitor activity around. Did we mention the PRO’s battery life is 10 years and it has a range of 260 feet? And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, the new Door/Window Sensor Pro also monitors the ambient temperature! Use the temperature information to monitor for extreme temperature fluctuation and keep your house safe from frozen pipes or damaged flooring.</p>",

	"info_usage": "<h3>Description &amp; Features</h3> <p>The Dome Door/Window Sensor is a battery powered security-enabled* Z-Wave Plus magnetic reed switch that can monitor the status of doors, windows, and anything else that opens and closes. It can also report ambient temperature levels. The Door/Window Sensor consists of two parts - the “sensor,” and the “magnet.” The sensor has a “reed switch” inside, which is sensitive to the magnet’s presence when aligned properly and within the defined distance. When the sensor and magnet are brought together or pulled apart, the sensor will report its open/close status to its Z-Wave controller, and the encrypted wireless communication* ensures that user data remains secure. Because many manufacturers use Z-Wave to communicate, the Door/Window Sensor can interact with different products of different categories.</p> <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p> <ul><li>Temperature Sensor</li> <li>Up to 220’ range</li> <li>Ten-Year Battery Life</li> <li>Z-Wave Signal Strength Indication</li> <li>1” Max distance between sensor &amp; magnet</li> <li>Ultra-Narrow (1/4”) Magnet (for Placement Between Door and Casing)</li> <li>Z-Wave Plus Certified</li> <li>S0 Security-Enabled*</li> <li>Monitor doors, windows, medicine cabinets, drawers, garage doors, and many other openings</li> </ul><p>*A security-enabled Z-Wave Plus controller is required to use all features of the Door/Window Sensor. </p> <h3>Specifications</h3> <p><strong>Technical Specifications</strong></p> <table><tr><td>Radio protocol</td> <td>Z-Wave(500 series)</td> </tr><tr><td>Power supply</td> <td>Single CR14505 3.6V battery</td> </tr><tr><td>Working current</td> <td>35mA</td> </tr><tr><td>Standby current</td> <td>7uA</td> </tr><tr><td>Radio frequency</td> <td>908.4 MHz US</td> </tr><tr><td>Range</td> <td>Up to 150’ depending on environment</td> </tr><tr><td>Dimensions (L x W x H)</td> <td>Sensor: 2.9” x 0.85” x 0.87” (75 x 21 x 22 mm) <br /> Magnet: 1.6” x 0.25” x 0.5” (40 x 6.35 x 12 mm)</td> </tr><tr><td>Package Contents</td> <td>User Manual, Sensor, Magnet, Battery, Double-Stick Tape, 2x Screws, 2x Wall Anchors</td> </tr></table> <h3>Factory Reset &amp; Misc.
