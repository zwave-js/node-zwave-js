        Because of the large amount of Z-Wave devices, we cannot write all configuration files ourselves.
        Help from the community is required, so we can focus our time on improving Z-Wave JS itself. 🙏🏻

        This issue has been labeled "Help wanted", meaning we kindly ask anyone who wants to help out for support. Here are a few resources to get you started - don't hesitate to ask if you are having problems:
