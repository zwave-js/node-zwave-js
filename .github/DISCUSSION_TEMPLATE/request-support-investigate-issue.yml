        ## Hi there!

        ---

        Since Z-Wave JS is used in multiple applications with a lot of moving parts, your issue might actually be caused by something outside our control.

        Let's start by finding out if we are able to help you...

        1. If this is about a **device** that is interviewed completely but does not **get identified**, please [use this template](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=config+%E2%9A%99&projects=&template=device_config.yml&title=Missing+device+configuration%3A+%3Center+manufacturer+and+device+name%3E) instead.

        1. Were you using **Z-Wave JS UI** (standalone or as an addon) when you encountered the problem?
        If **yes**: please open your issue at https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-ui/issues instead, **unless** you were told to report it here.

        1. Were you using **Home Assistant** (but not Z-Wave JS UI) when you encountered the problem?
        If **yes**, please open your issue at https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues instead, **unless** you were told to report it here.

        ## Driver Logfile

        We **need** a **driver** logfile on loglevel **DEBUG**. Many issues simply cannot be investigated without the correct logfile. If you don't provide one, the first thing we'll do is ask for one.

        Here's how to create one:

        - [Z-Wave JS  UI](https://zwave-js.github.io/zwave-js-ui/#/troubleshooting/generating-logs?id=driver-logs)
        - [Home Assistant Z-Wave Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js#how-do-i-access-the-z-wave-logs)
        - [ioBroker.zwave2 Adapter](https://github.com/AlCalzone/ioBroker.zwave2/blob/master/docs/en/troubleshooting.md#providing-the-necessary-information-for-an-issue)

        Please...

        - do not link to logs elsewhere, unless you absolutely cannot upload them here. If the logfile is too large, please try to **zip** it.
        - do not truncate or filter logs
        - do not set the loglevel to anything but **DEBUG**, unless you're told to
        - **upload** the log as a **file** here
        - avoid copy-pasting if you can avoid it

        **Note:**
        If the log is for a device included using **Security S0**, we need your S0 key to decode the traffic. You can send it via email to info@zwave-js.io - please include a link to this request.
