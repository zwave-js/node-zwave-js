		"exclusion": "If you don’t want to continue using a certain device it needs to be removed from homee. To do this go to the settings of the device you wish to remove by tapping on the pencil icon in the devices detail screen. \n\n\nThe button to remove the device is on the bottom of the screen. You have 60 seconds to activate the learn mode on the device you wish to remove after conﬁrmation of the removal. Doing this will remove the device from the Z-Wave network and reset it to its factory default settings",
		"reset": "NOTE:❗If the Z-Wave cube is reset to factory defaults, all connected Z-Wave devices will be removed and the cube gets a new Home ID. If homee is the primary controller for your network, resetting it will result in the nodes in your network being orphaned and it will be necessary after the reset to exclude and re-include all of the nodes in the network. If this controller is being used as a secondary controller in the network, use this procedure to reset this controller only in the event that the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.\n\nNOTE:❗❗ This process does NOT reset the connected devices itself. They need to be reset manually following the manufacturers manual.\n\n\nTo reset the Z-Wave Cube to its factory defaults you need to open the general homee settings. They are reachable via your homee’s icon in the top left corner and a subsequent press on the gear icon on the top right corner. Under the section [Cubes] > [Z-Wave] you can find all settings related to the Z-Wave cube. The menu entry [Reset Cube] resets the Z-Wave Cube back to its factory defaults after additional confirmation",
