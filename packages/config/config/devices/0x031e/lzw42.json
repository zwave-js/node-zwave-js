Once the inclusion process has started, turn on the bulb and it will immediately blink twice (2x) indicating it's in inclusion (pairing) mode.  If the bulb was included successfully, it will blink one more (1x) time.  If it was not included successfully, you may have to run an exclusion.  If there's still issues, please ensure your bulb is within range.",

Only use this procedure in the event that the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable.  Your bulb will flash twice to confirm factory reset.",
