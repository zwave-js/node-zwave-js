If you believe you’re within range and it’s still not working, then you may have to run an Exclusion. Put your HUB in Exclusion mode and turn the power on/off/on/off/on/off/on (3x on and 2x off) until your bulb blinks three (3x) and then blinks 1x to confirm. Your HUB should say that the device is excluded. You may then add (include) the bulb per the instructions below",

Only use this procedure in the event that the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable. Your bulb will flash twice to confirm factory reset",
