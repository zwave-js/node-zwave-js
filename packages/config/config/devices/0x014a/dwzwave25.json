		"inclusion": "1. Start by placing the controller into inclusion mode.\n2. Activate inclusion mode for the sensor by removing the plastic pull-tab from the back of the sensor. When the inclusion process is complete, the LED on the sensor will be solid blue, then go out.\n3. Test the sensor. Place the magnet next to the sensor to represent a closed position. If the LED flashes ONE TIME, it is successfully communicating on your Zwave network. If the LED on the sensor flashes slow and steady for 5 seconds, you need to repeat the inclusion process.\nNotes: If you need to repeat the inclusion process, repeat STEP ONE above, then for STEP TWO you will need to simply remove the cover of the sensor, remove the battery for 10 seconds, reinsert the battery, and replace the sensor cover. This will re-enter the sensor in inclusion mode.",
