		"inclusion": "1. Press the sensor latch with a slotting screwdriver to remove the lid of the sensor.\n2. Squeeze the sides of the sensor casing to alleviate pressure on the chipboard; slide the chipboard out.\n3. Remove the Pull Tab to engage the pre-installed battery. The sensor’s LED will fade the color red in and out for a few seconds to indicate that it’s powered on.\n4. Set your gateway into its 'add device' mode. Refer to its manual if you are unsure of how to perform this step. Then press Recessed Door Sensor 7's Action Button once; its LED will blink.\nIf your gateway supports S2 security, and you want your device to use this higher level of security, please enter the first 5 digits of the DSK into the gateway's interface when prompted. Refer to the gateway's manual if you are unsure how to perform this step. Do not lose the DSK or remove it from the product or package.\n5. When Recessed Door Sensor 7 successfully joins your Z-Wave network its LED will turn solid red for 10 minutes and then off. If fails, its LED turns slow fade-in fade-out red color. Repeat the above steps and please contact us for further support if needed.\n6. Squeeze the sides of the sensor casing lightly again and re-insert the chipboard as it was. Re-attach the lid",

Refer to the Controller's manual if you are unsure of how to perform this step.\n2. Make sure the product is powered. \n3. Single-click Action Button; LED will become flash red color for 5 seconds, which indicates entering exclusion mode. \n4. If the exclusion is successful, LED will change to the default unpaired state which is slow fade-in fade-out red color. \n5. Should its LED extinguish without slow fade-in fade-out red color, it indicates the exclusion is unsuccessful. Contact us for further support if needed",
		"reset": "If the primary controller is missing or inoperable, you may need to reset the device to factory settings.\nMake sure the product is powered. To complete the reset process manually, press and hold the Action Button for at least 20s, and Factory Reset is performed when released. The LED will become slow fade-in fade-out red color, which indicates the reset operation is successful. Contact us for further support if needed. \nNote: \n1. This procedure should only be used when the primary controller is missing or inoperable.\n2. Factory Reset will:\n(a) Remove the product from Z-Wave network;\n(b) Delete the Association setting;\n(c) Restore the configuration settings to the default.",
