		"inclusion": "This product supports Security 2 Command Class. While a Security S2 enabled Controller is needed in order to fully use the security feature. This product can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.\n\n(1) SmartStart Learn Mode\nSmartStart enabled products can be added into a Z-Wave network by scanning the Z-Wave QR Code present on the product with a controller providing SmartStart inclusion. No further action is required and the SmartStart product will be added automatically within 10 minutes of being switched on in the network vicinity.\nIndicator Light will become flash white light for 1s indicating the product has been powered, and then become flash blue light indicating SmartStart Learn Mode starts. It will become constantly bright yellow light after being assigned a NodeID.\nIf Adding succeeds, it will bright blue light for 2s and become Load Indicator Mode.\nIf Adding fails, it will bright red light for 2s and turn back to breathing blue light and then start SmartStart Learn Mode again.\nNote:\nThe label of QR Code on the product and package are used for SmartStart Inclusion. The Z-Wave DSK Code is at bottom of the package. Please do not remove or damage them.\n\n(2) Classic Inclusion Learn Mode\n1. Set your Z-Wave Controller into its 'Add Device' mode in order to add the product into your Z-Wave system. Refer to the Controller's manual if you are unsure of how to perform this step.\n2. Make sure the product is powered. If not, plug it into a wall socket and power on; its LED will be breathing blue light all the time. \n3. Click Action Button once, it will quickly flash blue light for 30 seconds until it is added into the network. It will become constantly bright yellow light after being assigned a NodeID.\n4. If your Z-Wave Controller supports S2 encryption, enter the first 5 digits of DSK into your Controller's interface if /when requested. The DSK is printed on its housing.\n5. If Adding fails, it will bright red light for 2s and then become breathing blue light; repeat steps 1 to 4. Contact us for further support if needed.\n6. If Adding succeeds, it will bright blue light for 2s and then turn to Load Indicator Mode. Now, this product is a part of your Z-Wave home control system. You can configure it and its automations via your Z-Wave system; please refer to your software's user guide for precise instructions.\nNote:\nIf Action Button is clicked again during the Classic Inclusion Learn Mode, the Classic Inclusion Learn Mode will exit. At the same time, Indicator Light will bright red light for 2s, and then become breathing blue light",

Refer to the Controller's manual if you are unsure of how to perform this step.\n2. Make sure the product is powered. If not, plug it into a wall socket and power on. \n3. Click Action Button 2 times quickly; it will bright violet light, up to 2s.\n4. If Removing fails, it will bright red light for 2s and then turn back to Load Indicator Mode; repeat steps 1 to 3. Contact us for further support if needed.\n5. If Removing succeeds, it will become breathing blue light. Now, it is removed from Z-Wave network successfully",

If not, plug it into a wall socket and power on. To complete the reset process manually, press and hold the Action Button for at least 15s and then release. The LED indicator will become breathing blue light, which indicates the reset operation is successful. Otherwise, please try again. Contact us for further support if needed. \nNote: \n1. This procedure should only be used when the primary controller is missing or inoperable.\n2. Factory Reset will:\n(a) Remove the product from Z-Wave network;\n(b) Delete the Association setting;\n(c) Restore the configuration settings to the default.",
