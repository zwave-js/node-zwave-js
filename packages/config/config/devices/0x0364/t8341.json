Use a screwdriver to detach the rear cover.\n2. Put the AXIS M6505 camera (Z-Wave controller) into inclusion mode.\n3. Insert 1 CR123 3V batteries into the battery compartment with the correct polarity. The LED on the device should turn ON\n4. The inclusion process should be completed when the LED stops blinking\n5. Perform test before you refit the rear cover.\nManual inclusion\nYou can also choose to manually add the Z-Wave device to a control device. Please follow the steps described below.\nNote\nFor best results, exclude the device before starting the inclusion process. For more details see the installation guide\n1. Press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into learning (inclusion/exclusion) mode.\n2. The inclusion process should be completed when the LED stops blinking\n3.
