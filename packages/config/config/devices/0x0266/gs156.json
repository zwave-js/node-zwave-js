		"inclusion": "Add (Including) Sensor To Z-Wave Network\r\nThe water alarm can be included to the Z-wave network by following operations:\r\n1. Power on the alarm.\r\n2. Make sure the alarm is on its final install location, then set the \tcontroller into the inclusion mode.\r\n3. Quickly, triple short the two sensing probes together with wet cloth, \tthe LED will flash alternately.\r\n4. The LED will flash 3 times with beeping after the alarm being Add (included) to the network successfully.\r\n",
		"exclusion": "Remove (Excluding) Sensor From Z-Wave Network\r\n1. Make sure the alarm is connected to power source.\r\n2. Set the Z-Wave Network controller into exclusion mode.\r\n3. Quickly, triple short the two sensing probes together by wet cloth, the LED light will flash for 3 times with beeping sound.\r\n4.

Wait for 5 seconds, When the LED is on, you should short the two sensing probes together with wet cloth within 5 seconds (before the LED turn off), and then remove the wet cloth quickly .\r\n 3. Repeat the Step2 one times.\r\n 4. The sensor will sound after successful operation, and it will last 2 seconds.\r\nNote: If this sensor is reset, the information of Z-Wave network in the sensor will be deleted.
