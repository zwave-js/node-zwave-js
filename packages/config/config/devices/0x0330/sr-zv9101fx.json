Power on the LED dimmer, make sure the LED dimmer does not belong to any Z-Wave network (please refer to the part “How to check whether the LED dimmer included to a network” of this manual).\n1) When the connected LED light flashes quickly for 6 seconds, it means the LED dimmer does not belong to any network. Triple press the “Inclusion/Exclusion” button, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.\n2) When the connected LED light is under solid on status, it means the LED dimmer has already been included into a network. First you have to set the LED dimmer into exclusion mode, once excluded, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.\nThe connected LED light stays solid on 3s to indicate successful inclusion",

Set the primary controller/gateway into exclusion mode (Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to set your controller into exclusion).\n2. Triple press the “inclusion/exclusion” button, the LED dimmer will be set to exclusion mode, the connected LED light will flash quickly for 6 seconds, and waiting to be excluded, then LED light stays solid on 3s to indicate successful exclusion.\nThere are 3 methods for the LED dimmer to quit “exclusion mode”. Once the LED dimmer quits “exclusion mode”, the LED light will stop the fast flash status.\n1. Automatically quits after successful exclusion.\n2. Quits after 10 seconds timeout.\n3. Power off and power on the LED dimmer.\n(Note: When the LED dimmer already included to a network, triple press\n“inclusion/exclusion” button, the LED dimmer will be set into exclusion mode and quit exclusion mode alternatively.)\nMethod 2: Factory reset the LED dimmer will force the LED dimmer to be excluded from a network. (please refer to the part “Factory Reset” of this manual)\nNote: Factory reset is not recommended for exclusion, please use this procedure only if the primary controller/gateway is missing or otherwise inoperable",
