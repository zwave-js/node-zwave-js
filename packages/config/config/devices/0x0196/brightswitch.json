Next, select either \"Z-Wave Reset *name*\" or \"Delete Entire *name*'s Network\". \n\nPlease note this process will break connections to all Z-Wave devices and they will need to be removed or reset individually before they can be added to another network. Also note that selecting \"Delete Entire *name*'s Network\" will instruct other Brightswitches on the network to reset their own Z-Wave processors, clearing all associations. Therefore please only use the reset is the primary controller is missing or inoperable",
