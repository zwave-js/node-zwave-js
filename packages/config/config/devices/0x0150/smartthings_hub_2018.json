After resetting, you can visit our Things category, find the devices you wish to set up, and follow the guides provided. Remember that you will likely need to reset or “exclude” every device before connecting.A physical factory reset is only possible for the Hub v2 with firmware 17.11 and up. If you have a Hub v1 or a Hub with firmware below 17.11, you can reset your Hub by deleting the Location it is connected to with these steps instead. Need to check your Hub’s firmware version?
