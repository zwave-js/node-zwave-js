Prepare the Z-Wave controller.\n2. Plug the cable plug to the wall socket to power up the unit.\n3. The Link LED will start to blink slowly with 2-second on, 2-second off (for 2 minutes) which shows the unit does not be paired.\n4. Within 30 seconds, put the Z-Wave Controller into inclusion mode.\n5. The Inclusion process should be completed when the Link LED stops blinking.\n\nNote: If you are connecting this unit to a Z-Wave Controller that utilizes the S2 security protocol, you may be asked by your controller to enter a 5-digit Device Specific Key (DSK) that is unique to each unit. This can be found in one of two places:\n- on the QR code label on the back of the unit\n- on the insert card inside the packaging.\n\n6. Turn on the floodlight using the controller to check if the auto inclusion is working properly.\n\nManual Inclusion\n1. Prepare the Z-Wave controller.\n2. Press the tamper switch 3 times within 1.5 seconds to put the unit into inclusion mode",
