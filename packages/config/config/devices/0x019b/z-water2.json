It indicates this for 90 seconds until a timeout occurs, or until the device has been added to the network. Configuration mode can also be cancelled by performing the same procedure used for starting Configuration mode.\nTo start the configuration process, press the reset button 3 times in rapid succession. The LED will light up solid green for 3 seconds if add is successful. The device is now ready for use with default settings.\nNB!
