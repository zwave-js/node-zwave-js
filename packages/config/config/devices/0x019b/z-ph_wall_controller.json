The device will indicate ”Success” by emitting a green light for 3 seconds. \n\nMethod 2: SmartStart (Automatic)\nSmartStart-enabled products may be added to a Z-Wave network by scanning the Z-Wave QR-Code on the product if your primary controller supports SmartStart inclusion. No further action is required and the SmartStart product will be added automatically after being powered on within range of the primary controller.",

The LEDs will start blinking 3 times before lighting up in green. When the green LED is on, you can release the button.
