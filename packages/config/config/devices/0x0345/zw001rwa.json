After the device has ben successfully added to the network, DO NOT plug anything into either receptacle outlet for at least 2 minutes to allow the module time to synchronize with the outlet metering hardware, or the accuracy of your meter readings may be adversely affected.\n\n1. Follow network ADD steps for your Z-Wave controller/hub to prepare the network to accept a device addition.\n2. Lightly press the push button on the Swidget Z-Wave Insert and hold for 10-15 seconds until the LED illuminates solid blue, then release the button. The LED will flash blue to indicate ADD mode is enabled. No manual or external Z-Wave operations are possible during this activity.\n3. The Swidget Z-Wave Insert will remain in ADD mode for up to 60 seconds. If the device is successfully added to the Z-Wave network, the LED will be solid blue for 5 seconds then return to the normal operational state; LED will be solid green if switch is ON (default), LED will not be illuminated if switch is OFF. If the device fails to be successfully added to the network after 60 seconds, the red LED will begin to flash. If necessary, consult your Z-Wave controller/hub manual and re-try. \n4.
