# Configuration file format

The following properties are defined and should always be present in the same order for consistency among the config files:

| Property            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `manufacturer`      | The name of the manufacturer (or brand under which the device is sold)                                                                                                                                     |
| `manufacturerId`    | The ID of the manufacturer (as defined in the Z-Wave specs) as a 4-digit hexadecimal string.                                                                                                               |
| `label`             | A short label for the device                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `description`       | A longer description of the device, usually the full name                                                                                                                                                  |
| `devices`           | An array of product type and product ID combinations, [see below](#devices) for details.                                                                                                                   |
| `firmwareVersion`   | The firmware version range this config file is valid for, [see below](#firmwareVersion) for details.                                                                                                       |

| `endpoints`         | Endpoint-specific configuration, [see below](#endpoints) for details. If this is present, `associations` must be specified on endpoint `"0"` instead of on the root level.                                 |
| `associations`      | The association groups the device supports, [see below](#associations) for details. Only needs to be present if the device does not support Z-Wave+ or requires changes to the default association config. |
| `paramInformation`  | A dictionary of the configuration parameters the device supports. [See below](#paramInformation) for details.                                                                                              |

| `compat`            | Compatibility flags used to influence the communication with non-complient devices. [See below](#compat) for details.                                                                                      |
| `metadata`          | Metadata that is intended to help the user, like inclusion instructions etc. [See below](#metadata) for details.                                                                                           |

## `devices`

Each device in the Z-Wave standard is identified by its product type and product ID. If a config file was imported from the _Z-Wave Alliance_ database, their identifiers are noted here too. A config file that is valid for both `0x0123 / 0x1000` and `0x2345 / 0x0001` would have the following `devices` entry:

```json
"devices": [
	{
		"productType": "0x0123",
		"productId": "0x1000"
	},
	{
		"productType": "0x2345",
		"productId": "0x0001",
		"zwaveAllianceId": 6789 // or an array, e.g. [6788, 6789]
	}
]
```

## `firmwareVersion`

Since different firmware versions of a device may have different config params, you must specify the firmware range for each config file. A config file that is valid from version `2.0` to `4.75` would have the following `firmwareVersion` entry:

```json
"firmwareVersion": {
	"min": "2.0",
	"max": "4.75"
}
```

The default `min` version is `0.0` and the default `max` version is `255.255`.
All other firmware ranges should be reflected in the filename. This also means that `0.0-` and `-255.255` should not be part of the filename, as they are implied.

> [!NOTE]
> Although some manufacturers tend to display firmware versions with leading zeroes, firmwares are interpreted as two numbers. This means `2.01` is equivalent to `2.1`. Leading zeroes **must not** be used in config files to avoid confusion.

## `metadata`

Can be used to add instructions for the user to a device:

```json
"metadata": {
	"wakeup": "How to wake up the device manually",
	"inclusion": "How to include this device",
	"exclusion": "How to exclude this device",
	"reset": "How to factory-reset this device",
	"manual": "A link to the device manual
}
```

## `endpoints`

Optional endpoint-specific configuration. For now this only includes associations. Example:

```json
"endpoints": {
	"0": {
		"associations": {
			// Association definitions for endpoint 0, see below for details
		}
	},
	"1": {
		"associations": {
			// Association definitions for endpoint 1, see below for details
		}
	},
	// etc.
}
```

## `associations`

For devices which do not allow auto-discovering associations, the associations must be defined in the config file.

Before defining `associations` in a config file, please make sure that **at least one** of the following points applies:

-   The device **does not** support `Z-Wave Plus CC` and `Association Group Info CC`
-   The auto-discovered labels are **bad** (content or formatting wise), like `GROUP_1` instead of something useful like `Multilevel Sensor Reports`
-   Additional lifelines besides the primary one are **necessary** to get all desired reports
-   `zwave-js` auto-assigns an endpoint association (node 1, endpoint 0) to the lifeline, but the device needs a node association (node 1, no endpoint) to report properly

The property looks as follows:

```json
"associations": {
	// One entry for each association group
	"1": {
		"label": "Label for group #1", // required
		"maxNodes": 5 // How many nodes may be in that group, required
	},
	"2": {
		"label": "Label for group #2",
		"description": "A description what group #2 does", // optional, only add this if it adds additional value
		"maxNodes": 1, // SHOULD be 1 for the lifeline, some devices support more nodes
		"isLifeline": true, // Whether this is the Lifeline group. SHOULD exist exactly once, some nodes require more groups to report everything
		"multiChannel": false, // Set this to false to force node id associations for this group, even if endpoint associations are supported. Default: `true`
	},
	// ... more groups ...
}
```

The `isLifeline` key is used to determine which group sends the controller device status updates.

To define associations for other endpoints than the root endpoint, you **must** specify `"associations"` inside the `"endpoints"` property.
If the same associations exist on the root endpoint and other endpoints, it is **recommended** to self-reference them via `$import`s.

> [!ATTENTION] Make sure to disable the `isLifeline` flag on endpoints if the **same** lifeline group is shared between multiple endpoints.

Example:

```json
"endpoints": {
	"0": {
		"associations": {
			"1": {
				"label": "Lifeline",
				"maxNodes": 5,
				"isLifeline": true
			},
			"2": {
				"label": "Button 1",
				"maxNodes": 5
			},
			"3": {
				"label": "Button 2",
				"maxNodes": 5
			},
		}
	},
	"1": {
		"associations": {
			"1": {
				// This group is shared with the root endpoint. Reference it from there, but don't auto-assign multiple times.
				"$import": "#endpoints/0/associations/1",
				"isLifeline": false
			},
			"2": {
				// This association also exists as group 2 on the root endpoint, so we reference it
				"$import": "#endpoints/0/associations/2"
			}
		}
	},
	"2": {
		"associations": {
			"1": {
				// This group is shared with the root endpoint. Reference it from there, but don't auto-assign multiple times.
				"$import": "#endpoints/0/associations/1",
				"isLifeline": false
			},
			"2": {
				// This association also exists as group 3 on the root endpoint, so we reference it
				"$import": "#endpoints/0/associations/3"
			},
			"3": {
				// This association only exists on endpoint 2
				"label": "Button 2: Double Tap",
				"maxNodes": 5
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## `paramInformation`

This property defines all the existing configuration parameters. It looks like this

```json
"paramInformation": {
	"1": { /* parameter #1 definition */},
	"2": { /* parameter #2 definition */},
	// ... more parameters ...
}
```

where each parameter definition has the following properties:

| Parameter property | Type    | Required? | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------- | :-------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `label`            | string  |    yes    | A short name for the parameter. <br />This **must not** include unnecessary white-space, such as newlines or tabs.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `description`      | string  |    no     | An **optional** longer description of what the parameter does.<br />If a description does not add **significant** value (for example if it just repeats the allowed values), it should be removed instead.<br />This **must not** include unnecessary white-space, such as newlines or tabs. |
| `valueSize`        | number  |    yes    | How many bytes the device uses for this value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `minValue`         | number  |    yes    | The minimum allowed value for this parameter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `maxValue`         | number  |    yes    | The maximum allowed value for this parameter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `defaultValue`     | number  |   maybe   | The factory default value of this parameter. This is required unless the parameter is `readOnly`.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `unit`             | string  |    no     | The unit for this parameter's values, e.g. `minutes`, `seconds`, `%`, `kWh`, `0.1 °C`, etc...                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `unsigned`         | boolean |    no     | Whether this parameter is interpreted as an unsigned value by the device (default: `false`). This simplifies usage for the end user.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `readOnly`         | boolean |    no     | Whether this parameter can only be read                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `allowManualEntry` | boolean |    no     | Whether this parameter accepts any value between `minValue` and `maxValue`. Defaults to `true` for writable parameters and `false` for `readOnly` parameters. If this is `false`, `options` must be used to specify the allowed values.                                                      |
| `options`          | array   |    no     | If `allowManualEntry` is omitted or `false` and the value is writable, this property must contain an array of objects of the form `{"label": string, "value": number}`. Each entry defines one allowed value.                                                                                |

### Partial parameters

Some devices use a single parameter number to configure several, sometimes unrelated, options. For convenience, `node-zwave-js` provides a simple way to define these values as multiple (partial) configuration parameters. For an in-depth explanation, see [the guide on partial parameters](config-files/partial-parameters.md).

For example,

```json
"40[0x01]": {
	"label": "Button 1: behavior",
	/* parameter definition */
},
"40[0x02]": {
	"label": "Button 1: notifications",
	/* parameter definition */
},
"40[0x04]": {
	"label": "Button 2: behavior",
	/* parameter definition */
},
"40[0x08]": {
	"label": "Button 2: notifications",
	/* parameter definition */
},
```

defines 4 partial parameters that each switch a single bit of parameter #40. Using the appended bit mask (e.g. `[0x01]`), you can configure which bits each partial parameter affects.

Partial parameters must follow these rules:

1. The `valueSize` must be the actual size of the parameter, as defined in the device manual (not just the part of the bitmask). Each partial parameter must have the same `valueSize`.
1. Each bitmask must fit into the configured `valueSize` of the parameter.
1. The `minValue`, `maxValue` and `defaultValue` as well as options values are relative to the lowest bit the bit mask. If the bit mask is `0xC` (binary `1100`), these properties must be in the range 0...3 (2 bits). Any required bit shifts are automatically done.

## `compat`

While the Z-Wave specs define how the protocol works and how devices must behave, the reality is different. `zwave-js` tries to be smart about this, but sometimes that is not enough. The following compat flags are available to influence how `zwave-js` communicates with these devices:

### `alarmMapping`

This option is used to translate V1 `alarmType` and `alarmLevel` to V2+ notifications. Although the V1 values are not standardized, some manufacturers use the same values for all of their devices. This property has the following shape:

```json
"compat": {
	"alarmMapping": [
		{
			"from": {
				"alarmType": 21, // or any other number between 0 and 255
				"alarmLevel": 2, // or any other number between 0 and 255 (optional)
			},
			"to": {
				"notificationType": 6, // or any other standardized notification type
				"notificationEvent": 5, // or any other standardized notification event
				"eventParameters": {
					// Additional event parameters for this notification event (optional)
					"someProperty": 1, // either a fixed number
					"userId": "alarmLevel", // or the reported alarmLevel
				}
			}
		}
	]
}
```

From the array of single mappings, the first one with a matching `alarmType` and `alarmLevel` is selected. You can leave out the `alarmLevel` to not match against it.
One use case for this is to use the `alarmLevel` as the `userId` in the `eventParameters`.

Single alarm mappings may be `$import`ed from templates.

### `commandClasses.add`

If a device does not report some CCs in its NIF, this can be used to add them. This property has the following shape:

```json
"compat": {
	"commandClasses": {
		"add": {
			// Adds the CC Anti-Theft
			"0x5d": {
				// CCs can be added to the root endpoint (0)...
				/** Whether the endpoint or node can react to this CC */
				"isSupported": true, // or false (optional)
				/** Whether the endpoint or node can control other nodes with this CC */
				"isControlled": true, // or false (optional)
				/** Whether this CC is ONLY supported securely */
				"secure": true, // or false (optional)
				/** The maximum version of the CC that is supported or controlled */
				"version": 2, // optional, default: 1

				// ... or to single endpoints
				"endpoints": {
					"1": {
						// same properties (isSupported, ...) as above
					},
					// ... more endpoints
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### `commandClasses.remove`

If a device reports support for a CCs but does not correctly support it, this can be used to remove them. This property has the following shape:

```json
"compat": {
	"commandClasses": {
		"remove": {
			// Removes the CC Anti-Theft from the node and all endpoints
			"0x5d": {

### `disableBasicMapping`

By default, received `Basic CC::Report` commands are mapped to a more appropriate CC. Setting `disableBasicMapping` to `true` disables this feature.

### `disableStrictEntryControlDataValidation`

The specifications mandate strict rules for the data and sequence numbers in `Entry Control CC Notifications`, which some devices do not follow, causing the notifications to get dropped. Setting `disableStrictEntryControlDataValidation` to `true` disables these strict checks.

### `enableBasicSetMapping`

`Basic CC::Set` commands are not meant to be mapped to other CCs. Some devices still use them to report status. By setting `enableBasicSetMapping` to `true`, `Basic CC::Set` commands are mapped just like `Basic CC::Report`s.

> [!NOTE] The option `disableBasicMapping` has precedence. If that is `true`, no `Basic` commands will be mapped.

### `forceNotificationIdleReset`

Version 8 of the `Notification CC` added the requirement that devices must issue an idle notification after a notification variable is no longer active. Several legacy devices and some misbehaving V8 devices do not return their variables to idle automatically. By setting `forceNotificationIdleReset` to `true`, `zwave-js` auto-idles supporting notification variables after 5 minutes.

### `manualValueRefreshDelayMs`

Some legacy devices emit an NIF when a local event occurs (e.g. a button press) to signal that the controller should request a status update. However, some of these devices require a delay before they are ready to respond to this request. `manualValueRefreshDelayMs` specifies that delay, expressed in milliseconds. If unset, there will be no delay.

### `mapRootReportsToEndpoint`

Some multi-channel devices incorrectly report state changes for one of their endpoints via the root device, however there is no way to automatically detect for which endpoint these reports are meant. The flag `mapRootReportsToEndpoint` can be used to specify which endpoint these reports are mapped to. Without this flag, reports to the root device are silently ignored, unless `preserveRootApplicationCCValueIDs` is `true`.

### `preserveEndpoints`

Many devices unnecessarily use endpoints when they could (or do) provide all functionality via the root device. `zwave-js` tries to detect these cases and ignore all endpoints. To opt out of this behavior or to preserve single endpoints, `preserveEndpoints` can be used. Example:

```js
"preserveEndpoints": "*",    // to preserve all endpoints
"preserveEndpoints": [2, 3], // to preserve endpoints 2 and 3, but ignore endpoint 1
```

### `preserveRootApplicationCCValueIDs`

The Z-Wave+ specs mandate that the root endpoint must **mirror** the application functionality of endpoint 1 (and potentially others). For this reason, `zwave-js` hides these superfluous values. However, some legacy devices offer additional functionality through the root endpoint, which should not be hidden. To achive this, set `preserveRootApplicationCCValueIDs` to `true`.

### `skipConfigurationInfoQuery`

Some devices spam the network with hundreds of invalid `ConfigurationCC::InfoReport`s when one is requested. Set this flag to `true` to skip this query for affected devices.

### `treatBasicSetAsEvent`

By default, `Basic CC::Set` commands are interpreted as status updates. This flag causes the driver to emit a `value event` for the `"value"` property instead. Note that this property is exclusively used in this case in order to avoid conflicts with regular value IDs.

> [!NOTE]
> If this option is `true`, it has precedence over `disableBasicMapping`.

### `treatDestinationEndpointAsSource`

Some devices incorrectly use the multi channel **destination** endpoint in reports to indicate the **source** endpoint the report originated from. When this flag is `true`, the destination endpoint is instead interpreted to be the source and the original source endpoint gets ignored.
