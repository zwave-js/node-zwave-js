# Problems with 700 series sticks (healing, delays, wrong neighbors, ...)

If you've got a 700 series stick and exhausted the other options, read and follow https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/issues/3906

Sorry, there's really nothing more to do at the moment, except downgrading back to the 500 series.
