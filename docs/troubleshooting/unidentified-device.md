# A device is not identified (unknown product)

In the Z-Wave standard, devices are identified by their "fingerprint", which are three numbers for **manufacturer ID**, **product type**, **product ID**. To map those to a device name, configuration files are required. However, for most of the functionality, these configuration files are **purely cosmetic**, especially for Z-Wave+ devices. It is likely that your device will work just fine, even if it is not recognized yet.
