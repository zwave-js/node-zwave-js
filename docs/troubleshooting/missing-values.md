Check if the interview is not yet completed. Check if the `ready` event has been emitted for the node in question. If not, have patience - the first interview of battery-powered nodes may take several hours. This can be sped up by waking them up manually, which might take multiple attempts. If the interview never gets completed, please consider opening an issue.

If the device is supposed to be using encryption, also check out [A lock (or any secure device) cannot be controlled](troubleshooting/lock-uncontrollable.md).
