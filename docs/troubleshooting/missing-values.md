Check if the interview is not yet completed. Check if the `ready` event has been emitted for the node in question. If not, have patience - the first interview of battery-powered nodes may take several hours. This can be sped up by waking them up manually, which might take multiple attempts.

> [!NOTE] A device that sends reports **does not** automatically mean it is awake. Refer to the device manual to figure out how to wake it up. Usually this is done by pressing a button on the device.

If the interview never gets completed, please consider opening an issue.

If the device is supposed to be using encryption, also check out [A lock (or any secure device) cannot be controlled](troubleshooting/lock-uncontrollable.md).
