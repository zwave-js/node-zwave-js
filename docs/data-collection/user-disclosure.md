# Project-Provided User Disclosure

Please allow the Z-Wave JS project to collect some anonymized data regarding the devices you own so that we can generate statistics that allow us to better focus our development efforts. This information is not tracked to any identifiable user or IP address and **cannot be used to identify you**. Specifically, we'd like to collect:

1. A hash of your network ID salted with a 32 byte randomly generated number, which is used to prevent duplicate records (this salted hash **cannot be undone** to reveal your network ID or identify you);

2. name and version of the application you are running;

3. information about which version of `node-zwave-js` you are running; and

4. the manufacturer ID, product type, product ID, and firmware version of each device that is part of your Z-Wave network.

Collecting this information is critical to the user experience provided by Z-Wave JS. More information about the data that is collected and how it is used, including an example of the data collected, can be found at: [https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/data-collection/data-collection?id=usage-statistics](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/data-collection/data-collection?id=usage-statistics).
