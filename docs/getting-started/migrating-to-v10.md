# Migrating to v10

What started out as an attempt to improve the testing setup, resulted in a huge refactor of the entire code base.

The implementations of serial messages and Command Classes have been decoupled from the `Driver`, `ZWaveNode` and `Endpoint` classes and no longer store direct references to them. Instead, most of the implementations now operate on abstractions:

-   `ZWaveHost` - A barebones abstraction of the environment, e.g. for simple test cases
-   `ZWaveApplicationHost` - A feature abstraction of the host environment with access to value DBs, other nodes, configuration, etc. `Driver` is an implementation of this abstraction.
-   `IZWaveEndpoint` - A barebones abstraction of a Z-Wave endpoint
-   `IZWaveNode` - A barebones abstraction of a Z-Wave node. Similar to how `ZWaveNode` is an `Endpoint`, an `IZWaveNode` is an `IZWaveEndpoint`
-   `IVirtualEndpoint` - A barebones abstraction of an endpoint on a virtual (multicast, broadcast) node
-   `IVirtualNode` - A barebones abstraction of a virtual (multicast, broadcast) node. Similar to how `VirtualNode` is a `VirtualEndpoint`, an `IVirtualNode` is an `IVirtualEndpoint`

These abstractions are mainly used internally. Object instances exposed to applications throught the `Driver` will still be `ZWaveNode`s and `Endpoint`s.

For many use cases, these changes should not affect applications, unless they are using some CC methods directly. The `commandClasses` APIs are unchanged.

## CC implementations: methods with driver access take a `ZWaveApplicationHost` as the first argument

Old signature:

```ts
public async interview(): Promise<void>;
public async refreshValues(): Promise<void>;
public persistValues(): boolean;
public toLogEntry(): MessageOrCCLogEntry;

public getDefinedValueIDs(): ValueID[];
public translateProperty(
	property: string | number,
	propertyKey?: string | number,
): string | undefined;
public translatePropertyKey(
	property: string | number,
	propertyKey?: string | number,
): string | undefined;
```

New signatures:

```ts
public async interview(applHost: ZWaveApplicationHost): Promise<void>;
public async refreshValues(applHost: ZWaveApplicationHost): Promise<void>;
public persistValues(applHost: ZWaveApplicationHost): boolean;
public toLogEntry(applHost: ZWaveApplicationHost): MessageOrCCLogEntry;

public getDefinedValueIDs(applHost: ZWaveApplicationHost): ValueID[];
public translateProperty(
	applHost: ZWaveApplicationHost,
	property: string | number,
	propertyKey?: string | number,
): string | undefined;
public translatePropertyKey(
	applHost: ZWaveApplicationHost,
	property: string | number,
	propertyKey?: string | number,
): string | undefined;
```

Simply pass the driver instance as the first argument whenever you call these methods.

**Note:** `getDefinedValueIDs` on the `ZWaveNode` class is **not** affected.

## CC-specific methods to read certain values from cache are now static take additional arguments

Some CC implementations expose value-specific methods to read certain values from cache, for example `getNumValvesCached` on the `Irrigation CC`. Previously some of those were protected, some were public. Now all of them are public, `static` on the CC base class, take additional arguments and include `undefined` in the return type:

Old signature:

```ts
protected getNumValvesCached(): number;
```

New signature:

```ts
public static getNumValvesCached(
	applHost: ZWaveApplicationHost,
	endpoint: ZWaveEndpointBase,
): number | undefined;
```

The same is true for several other similar methods on several other CCs. To use them from application code, simply pass the `Driver` and `Endpoint` or `ZWaveNode` instance:

```diff
- irrgCCInstance.getNumValvesCached();
+ IrrigationCC.getNumValvesCached(driver, endpoint);
```

## The `valueFormat` property in `ConfigurationCCBulkSetOptions` no longer defaults to the last stored format

Instead, if no `valueFormat` is passed, the default will be `SignedInteger` according to the specification. This change does not affect `setBulk` calls through the `commandClasses` API.

## `CommandClass.interviewComplete` is no longer a property

Instead, two methods are used in its place:

Old:

```ts
if (!instance.interviewComplete) {
	instance.interviewComplete = true;
}
```

New signature:

```ts
if (!instance.isInterviewComplete(applHost)) {
	instance.setInterviewComplete(applHost, true);
}
```

## `NotificationCC.notificationMode` is no longer a property

Instead, a static method on the `Notification CC` is used in its place:

```ts
// On NotificationCC
public static getNotificationMode(
	applHost: ZWaveApplicationHost,
	node: ZWaveNodeBase,
): "push" | "pull" | undefined;
```

## The max. send attempts in SendData messages now defaults to 1 instead of the driver option

If you're constructing `SendData[Bridge][Multicast]Request`s manually, the `maxSendAttempts` property now needs to be set if more than 1 attempts are desired.
The driver does this automatically when using the `sendCommand` method, so most use cases should not be affected.

## Moved the `Driver.interviewNode` method to the `ZWaveNode` class

The method `interviewNode(node: ZWaveNode)` which is meant to kick off a deferred initial interview for a node was moved to the `ZWaveNode` class.
The new signature is now `node.interview()`.

## The firmware update service now requires API keys

There will be a grace period on this, but soon after the release of v10, the service will respond with an error when no or an invalid API key is provided.
Please refer to https://github.com/zwave-js/firmware-updates/ for requesting an API key and set it using the new `apiKeys.firmwareUpdateService` property on the driver options.

## Removed the `"zwave-js/CommandClass"` sub-package export

The CC implementations have been moved to their own package, `@zwave-js/cc`. Simply replace the imports with the new package name.

## Removed the `sendSupervisedCommand` and `trySendCommandSupervised` driver methods

Whether supervision is used or not can now be controlled by the `options` argument of the `sendCommand` method. By default, the driver will now determine on its own whether supervision should be used or not. As a result, a wider range of commands can now be sent with supervision automatically.

## Removed several deprecated method signatures, enums and properties

-   The enum `EventTypes` did not give any context to which CC it belongs and has been removed. Use the `EntryControlEventTypes` enum instead.
-   The enum `RecordStatus` did not give any context to which CC it belongs and has been removed. Use the `DoorLockLoggingRecordStatus` enum instead.
-   The type `Association` was not specific enough and has been deprecated for a long time. It has now been removed. Use `AssociationAddress` instead.
-   The `set` method overload of the `Configuration CC` API with 4 parameters has been removed. Use the overload the single options object instead.
-   The `Controller.beginInclusion` method overload with the `boolean` parameter has been removed. Use the overload with the `InclusionOptions` object instead.
    **NOTE:** If you do not pass this object, the new node will be included without security.
-   The `Controller.replaceFailedNode` method overload accepting the node ID as the second parameter has been removed. Use the overload with the `ReplaceNodeOptions` object instead.
    **NOTE:** If you do not pass this object, the new node will be included without security.
-   The `Controller.getAssociationGroups` method overload with the `nodeId: number` parameter has been removed. Use the overload with the `AssociationAddress` object instead.
-   The `Controller.getAssociations` method overload with the `nodeId: number` parameter has been removed. Use the overload with the `AssociationAddress` object instead.
-   The `Controller.isAssociationAllowed` method overload accepting the node ID as the first parameter has been removed. Use the overload which accepts an `AssociationAddress` object instead.
-   The `Controller.addAssociations` method overload accepting the node ID as the first parameter has been removed. Use the overload which accepts an `AssociationAddress` object instead.
-   The `Controller.removeAssociations` method overload accepting the node ID as the first parameter has been removed. Use the overload which accepts an `AssociationAddress` object instead.
-   The `networkKey` driver option has been removed. Use `securityKeys.S0_Legacy` instead.
-   The `Controller.isSecondary` property was removed. Use `Controller.isPrimary` instead.
-   The `Controller.isStaticUpdateController` property was renamed to `isSUC` to be in line with the similar `isSIS` property.
-   The `Controller.isSlave` property was removed. Use the `Controller.nodeType` property to distinguish between `Controller` and `End Node` instead.
-   The `GetSerialApiInitDataResponse.initVersion` property was removed. Use the `zwaveApiVersion` property instead, which gives additional context.

## Deprecated the `unprovision` argument to `Controller.beginExclusion`

The current variant of the argument was confusing, so it has been deprecated. Use the new `ExclusionOptions` object parameter instead. Z-Wave JS now defaults to disabling the provisioning entry.

```ts
async beginExclusion(options?: ExclusionOptions): Promise<boolean>

type ExclusionOptions = {
	strategy:
		| ExclusionStrategy.ExcludeOnly
		| ExclusionStrategy.DisableProvisioningEntry
		| ExclusionStrategy.Unprovision;
};

enum ExclusionStrategy {
	/** Exclude the node, keep the provisioning entry untouched */
	ExcludeOnly,
	/** Disable the node's Smart Start provisioning entry, but do not remove it */
	DisableProvisioningEntry,
	/** Remove the node from the Smart Start provisioning list  */
	Unprovision,
}
```

## Further deprecations:

-   The `"Routing End Node"` enum member for the `NodeType` enum was deprecated. Use the alternative `"End Node"` instead.
