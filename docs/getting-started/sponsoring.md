# Sponsoring the development of Z-Wave JS

You might find yourself asking what's the point in spending 1000$ or more monthly on an open source project when the code is out there for you to use.

## Famous last words

Three years later I can tell you: **I've never been so wrong in my entire life.** Z-Wave is complicated. If there are 3 ways to do something, there will be devices on the market that do it in 5 different ways. The documentation is all over the place. Nothing states the intended or preferred way to achieve something. Things that are stated clearly in the documentation are done wrong in the worst ways imaginable.

In retrospect, this is probably the reason why there are so few Z-Wave drivers available.

## What's in it for you

Let's say your company wants to build a gateway solution based on Z-Wave. You start by hiring a couple of developers, have them read circa 2000 pages of specifications and start building your solution. They'll spend the next few months at least building your solution, trying out things that are not clear from the specifications, making mistakes over and over, and wasting time figuring out the best ways to achieve things that are not specified.

I've been there. I've read those specifications over and over, I've made those mistakes and learned from them, I've discussed best practices with experts. I don't know everything, but I've got a pretty good grasp on the DOs and DONTs by now.

On the other hand, if you're a device manufacturer, you are probably interested in having your devices **just work**. Some of the largest open source home automation projects are using Z-Wave JS already with more to come.

What you get by becoming a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/AlCalzone) (silver level or above) is **me**. I will:

-   support you in using Z-Wave JS or developing with it
-   try to prioritize your issues, as long as they are reasonable and align with our goals
-   consult you regarding best practices in terms of device functionality

In short, I will save you time and headaches and save you from having to go through the same problems as I did.

## Roadmap

There is still some way to go, but the plan is for **Z-Wave JS** to be the first **certified** open source Z-Wave driver. Meaning you can use it and expect it to **just work** with other certified devices. Some of the next steps on that way are:

-   StartSmart
-   Z-Wave Long Range

Your support will help speed up that process by enabling me to work on this full time.

Thanks!
