# AlCalzone's Device/Manufacturer Review {docsify-ignore-all}

## Disclaimer

?> This is an alphabetic list of manufacturers from which I would buy devices or not. It is highly **subjective**, but I'll give explanations for each recommendation - positive or negative. My review is based on 5 years of tech support in this repository, personal experience with some of the devices and information others in the community have posted about them.
Take everything with a grain of salt and do what you want with it.\

## Undecided

?> I don't have enough experience with these, so here are some preliminary thoughts...

- **GE** - I'm not US-based, so I can't test. Very popular, but many reports of these just breaking after several years. No firmware updates ❌. Probably 👎🏻
- **Linear/Nortek** - Anecdotally some reports of them being very tricky to include in the network.
