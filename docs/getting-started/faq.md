# Frequently Asked Questions

## Does Z-Wave JS support secondary controllers?

Yes and no.

Z-Wave JS expects to **be the primary controller** in the network and it will try to assume that role when started. It will not work correctly as a secondary controller.

It does however support **having secondary controllers in the network**. This includes:

- Including/excluding a secondary controller
- Letting secondary controllers (inclusion controllers) include and exclude devices
- Perform network key exchange with devices included by a secondary controller
