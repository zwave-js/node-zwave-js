* Fixed an issue where `ThermostatModeCC` would save its values twice (#5019)
* Ensure value ID received from outside code is valid and normalized before passing through (#5036)
* Merge notification metadata for variables with multiple states (#5037)

### Changes under the hood

## 9.0.0 (2022-04-03) · _„You had my curiosity. But now you have my attention.”_
Roughly nine months after the [last major release](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v8.0.1), we've reached a new milestone.
Z-Wave JS is now 4 years old, its usage has more than doubled over the course of the `v8.x` release line and it is still growing steadily. There are many exciting things yet to come, so stay tuned!

### Breaking changes · [Migration guide](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating-to-v9)
