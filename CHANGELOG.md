## 8.1.0 (2021-08-15) ¬∑ _‚ÄûHell, it's about damn time‚Äù_
### Features
Just one, but it's a big one: We added support for **Security S2** inclusion and singlecast communication üéâ.  
As it looks like, **Z-Wave JS** is the first open source library to support **Security S2**.

If you plan to add support in your application, see the [documentation](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/security-s2) and [PR description](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/pull/1136) for details - this also requires UI changes.

### Bugfixes
* The firmware target selection for targets other than 0 no longer incorrectly complains about an incorrect target
* Avoid writing into `node_modules` when updating an external configuration directory
* When an endpoint shares its lifeline with the root (i.e. has 0 max. associations), the root's associations are now ignored when determining how the endpoints's associations should be configured

### Config file changes
* Add another product ID variant to Yale YRD210
* Update and cleanup Fibaro Walli Double Switch
* Preserve root endpoint values for TZ06
* Allow manual entry for Zooz ZSE11 Param 12
* Add missing fingerprint to MCOHome MH9-CO2-WD
* Fix Heltun HE-RS01 parameters 41-45

## 8.0.8 (2021-08-04)
### Bugfixes
* ~~The firmware target selection for targets other than 0 no longer incorrectly complains about an incorrect target~~

### Config file changes
* Add Silabs UZB3 500 series controller device
* Correct parameter 81 for Aeotec ZW100
* Add MCO Home MH5-2a and MH-S510, correct others
* Updates to Fibaro FGS223 and FGD212
* Add groups for Heatit Smoke Battery
* Add support for HELTUN HE-HLS01, HE-HT01, HE-RS01
* Update Fibaro FGT001 for v8 changes, preserve root and endpoint 2
* Map root reports to endpoint 1 for Fibaro FGS211/221
* Add option 11 to ZEN17 parameters 2 and 3
* Update non-device configs (indicators, notifications, ...) to certification package 2020C

## 8.0.7 (2021-08-02)
### Bugfixes
Improved the heuristic for lifeline associations, which should resolve some reporting issues with devices:
* If the root endpoint of a device is configured to use a node association, the fallback for the other endpoints no longer creates a multi channel association on the root endpoint
* If the endpoints of a multi channel device don't support associations, the default lifeline on the root device will be configured as a multi channel association

### Config file changes
* Correct values sizes for zw096/zw099
* Correct device file for Ecolink ISZW7
* Preserve root endpoint values for Aeotec DSB09

## 8.0.6 (2021-07-28)

* Avoid overwriting the `.json` cache file with empty data on shutdown
* Removing associations from non-multichannel groups now works correctly
* The endpoint device class is now stored correctly when all endpoints have identical capabilities

* Always treat 1-bit partial parameters as unsigned

### Config file changes
* Add fingerprint for Heatit Smoke battery

### Changes under the hood
* Fixed some bot scripts that broke when switching to `yarn`

## 8.0.4 (2021-07-21)

## 8.0.2 (2021-07-20)
### Bugfixes

## 8.0.1 (2021-07-20) ¬∑ _‚ÄûThere are things out there that our little minds will never comprehend...‚Äù_
> _...one of them being the Z-Wave specifications._  
> &mdash; H. G. Tannhaus (from ‚ÄûDark‚Äù, probably)

Jokes aside, I'd like to use this release as an opportunity to look back on the history of Z-Wave JS. I started this project in 2018 out of frustration with the state of the open source Z-Wave ecosystem. I'm sure this sounds familiar to you if you're reading this. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. Originally, I just needed something that works for me, but decided to share it with the world.

Well, here we are. After...
* almost **3.5 years**,
* over **4000 commits** by over **150 contributors** (including some bots),
* about **2 million additions and deletions**,
* reading over **2000 pages** of cryptic specifications
* **millions of log lines**,
* and investing more time that I feel comfortable knowing about,

I'm starting to understand why there are so few (good and open source) Z-Wave drivers available.

Nonetheless, Z-Wave JS is picking up momentum and is getting used used more and more, both by open source and commercial projects. A while ago, we added usage statistics (opt-in), so we have at least some idea of how many people are using Z-Wave JS. As of today, Z-Wave JS is powering over 5,000 Z-Wave networks all over the world with over 70,000 devices (that we know of).

This wouldn't have been possible without all the support I've gotten so far. I'd like to thank everyone who has supported me over the years, both financially and by contributing. A big shoutout is especially due to
* [robertsLando](https://github.com/robertsLando) for building the excellent [`zwavejs2mqtt`](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwavejs2mqtt) (and discovering this project, I guess üòÖ)
* [marcus-j-davies](https://github.com/marcus-j-davies) for his work on the [config DB browser](https://devices.zwave-js.io/)
* and [blhoward2](https://github.com/blhoward2) for his incredible support with taking our device configuration files to the next level.

**What's next?**  
With this `v8` release, most of the pain points from previous versions and concerning compatibility with legacy Z-Wave devices should finally be resolved. This opens up the opportunity to focus on new and exciting features. On that list are the long-awaited **Security S2**, **SmartStart** and eventually the new **Z-Wave Long Range**.

**Road to certification**  
As you may already know, if you're planning to market a product or software with the official Z-Wave logos, certification is required for the entire product, from the hardware over the driver to the UI. In its current state, **Z-Wave JS** is not yet ready for certification (neither are the alternatives, for that matter). If your company is relying on Z-Wave JS, please consider paving that road by contributing to the project and/or [sponsoring me](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/sponsoring). I'd love to be able to work full-time on Z-Wave JS and make it the **first** certified open source Z-Wave driver. While Z-Wave JS is free, your support will allow me to continue to make it better and reach that goal even faster.

**TL;DR:** Z-Wave JS rocks! You rock! Now let's take a look at the changelog...

---

### Breaking changes ¬∑ [Migration guide](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating-to-v8)
* User codes are no longer queried during the interview in order to save battery
* Restructured interview settings in `ZWaveOptions`
* Reworked how endpoints and lifeline associations are handled
* Removed `neighbors` property from `ZWaveNode` class and removed `InterviewStage.Neighbors`
* Added missing `node` argument to nodes' `"statistics updated"` event
* The minimum required Node.js version is now `v12.22.2`
* The repository has been migrated from `yarn v1` to `yarn v3`. This changes a few things, mainly regarding installing dependencies and editor support and might require manual intervention after updating the repo.
* Change secondary exports to `package.json` subpath exports
* Both fields in `BatteryHealthReports` may be `undefined`

### Features
* Support `invokeCCAPI` and `supportsCCAPI` on virtual nodes/endpoints (multicast/broadcast)

* Add support for receiving `Transport Service CC V2` encapsulated commands

### Bugfixes
* Improved error messages that explain why a firmware update failed
* Multicast/Broadcast `setValue` now also accepts an options object
* `start/stopLevelChange` now correctly works for multicast/broadcast
* Added `typesVersions` to `zwave-js/package.json`, so TypeScript finds the subpath exports when used from consuming applications
* The `endpointIndizes` value is now correctly marked as internal

### Config file changes
* Add Heatit ZM Single Relay 16A
* Add metadata to Evolve products
* Add config file for Aeotec ZWA011

### Changes under the hood
* Updated several dependencies
* Config files can now use the `~/` prefix to refer to the config directory root
