### Breaking changes · [Migration guide](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating-to-v6)
* Logging can now be configured through driver options. However, the environment variables for logging are no longer evaluated lazily, so they now need to be set before requiring `zwave-js`.
* The second (string) parameter of the `"interview failed"` event handler was removed
* The type `ValueMetadataBase` has been renamed to `ValueMetadataAny`. The old type `ValueMetadataAny` was merged into `ValueMetadataBase`.
* The retry strategy for sending commands to nodes has been revised. By default, a message is no longer re-transmitted when the node has acknowledged its receipt, since it is unlikely that the retransmission will change anything. The old behavior can be restored by setting the `attempts.retryAfterTransmitReport` driver option to `true`.  
To compensate for the change and give the response enough time to reach the controller, the default for `timeouts.response` has been increased from `1600` to `10000`.
* The driver now distinguishes between stateful and event values. The latter are now exclusively exposed through the `"value notification"` event.
* The deprecated `nodeInterviewAttempts` option was removed
* The options `fs` and `cacheDir` have been renamed to `storage.driver` and `storage.cacheDir`.
* Loggers are now managed on a per-driver basis. This means you can use zwave-js to talk to different controllers and have separate logs for each.
* The `lookupXYZ` methods are no longer exposed by `@zwave-js/config`. Use the `configManager` property of your driver instance instead.

### Config file changes
* The index file was removed from the repo and is now generated on demand
* Several improvements for GE dimmers and switches
* Added missing config parameters to IDLock 150
* Added Innovelli LZW36 and First Alert ZCOMBO-G
* Added Technisat Dimmer and series switch
* Added Lifeline association to Danfoss MT 2649
* Added product id/type to NAS-WR01ZE
* Added Inovelli LZW31 Black Series Dimmer
* Added Aeotec ZW187 Recessed Door Sensor 7
* Added checks for partial parameters
* Added Aeotec ZWA009 aerQ Temperature and Humidity Sensor
* Added Honeywell 39348/ZW4008
* Added Zooz zst10-700 z-wave usb stick
* Added Fibaro Smart Switch FGS-214 and FGS-224
* Added Fortrezz fts05p
* Added an additional product type to Aeotec Range Extender 7
* Added iblinds V3
* Change manufacturer Jasco Products to GE/Jasco
* Renamed config param #11 in Q-Light Puck
* Removed an unsupported parameter from GE 14294
* New versions of `@zwave-js/config` are now automatically released every night if **only** config files were changed since the last release.  
You can run `npm update @zwave-js/config` in the `zwave-js` install dir to pull the latest config files. For now, a driver restart is required afterwards.

### Features
* Added basic support for 700-series controllers
* Added a compatibility option to disable the `Basic CC` mapping
* Added a compatibility option to treat `Basic CC::Set` commands as events instead of `Report`s
* Added a compatibility option `skipConfigurationInfoQuery` to work around a firmware issue in `Heat-It Z-TRM2fx`
* A driver option was added to enable logging to the console, even if it is not a TTY
* A driver option was added to control the filesystem access throttling
* Improved the `label` for `Level low` property in `BatteryCC`
* Unimplemented CCs may now be sent
* The version of `zwave-js` is now exported as `libVersion` from the main entry point
* Implemented `Battery CC V3`
* Added support for `Hail CC`
* ValueIDs that use a `Duration` instance as the value now have the metadata type `"duration"`
* Added a workaround for devices that return an invalid response when finding the first configuration param
* Added a `hexColor` property to the `Color Switch CC`

### Bugfixes
* Fixed an off-by-one error in the `Binary Sensor Supported Report` bitmask.  
**Note:** If your devices are affected by this bug, re-interview them to remove corrupted values.
* Expire nonces for `keepS0NonceUntilNext` devices until **after** the next nonce was received by the device
* The interview is no longer aborted when a device does not respond to the Wakeup Capability query
* Fixed a crash that could happen when compressing the value DB with an existing backup file.
* Fixed a wrong value ID for `Multilevel Switch CC` `targetValue`
* The driver no longer assumes that a sleeping node falls asleep after a certain time
* The name and location of a node is no longer deleted when the node gets re-interviewed and **does not** support `Node Naming And Location CC`
* The `propertyKeyName` of `Meter CC` values now contains the Meter type name

### Changes under the hood
* Test releases for PRs can now be created with a command
* PRs titles are now enforced to comply with conventional commits
* Config json files are now automatically formatted in VSCode and linted
* While editing device config files, supporting IDEs can now use a JSON schema to help you
* We've added @zwave-js-bot to help us manage the repo and to help you contribute
