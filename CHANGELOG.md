## __WORK IN PROGRESS__
Z-Wave JS is now able to run in the browser! This allows for new use-cases like interactive usage examples in the documentation, and building web-based Z-Wave tools.

### Bugfixes
* Fixed: Firmware updates fail to start on some devices with error "invalid hardware version" (#7452)

### Changes under the hood
* Classes that emit events are now based on the DOM compatible `EventTarget` class instead of Node.js's proprietary `EventEmitter`. This means that some methods like `prependListener` no longer exist, but we haven't found any usage of this in the wild.

### Bugfixes
* Fixed an issue where CC classes would have a different name when `zwave-js` was loaded as CommonJS, changing how those CCs were handled (#7426)

### Changes under the hood

## 14.3.3 (2024-11-14)
### Bugfixes
* Fix parsing of some older 500 series NVM formats (#7399)
* Fixed an issue where `mock-server` would not start due to an incorrect module format (#7401)

### Config file changes
* Add HomeSys HomeMech-2001/2 (#7400)

## 14.3.2 (2024-11-12)

### Config file changes
* Ignore setpoint range for Ecolink TBZ500 (#7393)

### Changes under the hood
* Further reduce dependency on Node.js internals (#7394)

## 14.3.0 (2024-11-11)
This release adds support for using the WebCrypto API as the cryptography backend. Unlike the `node:crypto` module, this API is supported by all modern browsers and JS runtimes.

Technically this is a breaking change, as `SecurityManager2` now needs to be instantiated asynchronously using `await SecurityManager2.create()` instead of `new SecurityManager2()`. However, we don't expect anyone to use this class directly, so this will not be marked as a semver-major release.

### Changes under the hood
* Improve portability of the library by supporting the WebCrypto API as cryptography backend (#7386)

## 14.2.0 (2024-11-07)
### Changes under the hood
* Improved tree-shakability (#7376, #7379)

## 14.1.0 (2024-11-06)
### Features
* Allow specifying RF region for OTA firmware updates if the region is unknown or cannot be queried (#7369)
* Add `tryUnzipFirmwareFile` utility to support zipped OTA firmware files (#7372)

### Bugfixes
* Parse negative setback state consistently (#7366)
* Ignore LR nodes when computing neighbor discovery timeout (#7367)
* Automatically fall back to `Europe` when setting region to `Default (EU)` (#7368)

### Changes under the hood
* Improve bundler-friendlyness of `@zwave-js/core` and `@zwave-js/shared` with new browser-specific entry points and `sideEffects` hints (#7374)

## 14.0.0 (2024-11-05)
In this release, a lot of the internal API was refactored to decrease interdependencies. Technically this results in a huge list of breaking changes, but most of those should not affect any application, unless very low-level APIs are frequently used. For example, Z-Wave JS UI and Z-Wave JS Server had just two small breaks. In addition, Z-Wave JS is now released as hybrid ESM/CJS packages.

### Breaking changes · [Migration guide](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating/v14)
* `Driver.installConfigUpdates()` now requires the external config directory to be configured (#7365)

* `zwave-js` no longer loops up the package version at runtime (#7344)
* Changed some paths to be relative to `process.cwd()` instead of source location (#7345)
* Decouple CCs and messages from host, split parsing and creation, split ZWaveNode class (#7305)

### Config file changes
* Add Aeotec TriSensor 8 (#7342)

### Changes under the hood
* Decorators have been migrated from the legacy specification to the accepted proposal (#7360)
* Transition modules to hybrid ESM/CJS, switch to vitest for testing (#7349)
* Removed dependency on `fs-extra` in favor of `node:fs/promises` (#7335)
* `@zwave-js/config` no longer loops up the package version at runtime (#7343)

## 13.5.0 (2024-10-07)
This release adds an internal task scheduler that will allow more control over longer running tasks like device interviews, route rebuilding, firmware updates, etc. These improvements include pausing/resuming tasks, better prioritization for user-initiated actions, queueing tasks without interrupting ongoing ones, and more. Migration of existing features to the new scheduler will be done incrementally, starting with route rebuilding.
