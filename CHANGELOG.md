## 12.2.0 (2023-10-17)
This release includes several more fixes and workarounds for the problematic interaction between some controller firmware bugs and the automatic controller recovery introduced in the `v12` release:
* Added a workaround to recognize corrupted `ACK` frames after soft-reset of controllers running an 7.19.x firmware or higher. Previously this triggered the unresponsive controller detection and recovery process. (#6409)
* When the response to a `Send Data` command times out, the command is now aborted, instead of retrying and potentially putting the controller in a bad state due to not waiting for the command cycle to complete. When this happens, Z-Wave JS no longer attempts to recover the controller by restarting it, unless the callback is also missing. (#6408)
* When the callback to a `Send Data` command continues to be missing after restarting the controller, Z-Wave JS no longer restarts itself. Instead the old behavior of marking the node as `dead` is now restored, as the node being unresponsive/unreachable is most likely the actual problem. (#6403)
* In addition, the `Send Data` callback timeout has been reduced to 30 seconds and ongoing transmissions are now aborted before reaching this timeout. This should limit the impact of the controller taking excessively long to transmit, especially in busy networks with lots of unsolicited reporting and end nodes expecting a timely response (#6411)

### Features
* The `Driver` constructor now accepts multiple sets of options and curated presets are available (#6412)

### Additional Bugfixes
* Only auto-refresh `Meter` and `Multilevel Sensor CC` values if none were updated recently (#6398)
* Export all option types for `Configuration CC` (#6413)

### Config file changes
* Add NEO Cool Cam Repeater (#6332)
* Increase report timeout for Aeotec Multisensor 6 to 2s (#6397)

## 12.1.1 (2023-10-12)
### Bugfixes
* Fixed a long standing issue that prevented multi-target firmware updates from being applied correctly (#6395)
* Fixed an issue with multi-target firmware updates where the wrong update capabilities were exposed to applications, preventing manual updates of the additional targets (#6396)

### Config file changes
* Add parameter 26 to `Inovelli VZW31-SN` (#6391)

## 12.1.0 (2023-10-11)
### Config file changes
Almost 1000 device configuration files have been reworked to be more consistent, mostly affecting device labels, parameter labels, descriptions and predefined options.
After updating, you should expect to see several notifications for changed device configurations, prompting you to re-interview the affected nodes.
Unless the device is mentioned below, there's no need to do this immediately.

* Always set time for Namron 16A thermostats as UTC (#6388)
* Add Alloy (Zipato) devices (#6331)
* Parameter 21 of Inovelli VZW31-SN is readonly (#6389)
* Add Shelly Wave Shutter (#6382)

* Add params 7, 18, 19 to Zooz ZEN71 FW 10.20 (#6375)
* Add Qubino Shades Remote Controller (#6335)
* Add fingerprint for new MH8-FC version, add new option for param 1 (#6358)
* Add Hank HKZW-SO08 (#6383)
* Add link to manual of Honeywell T6 Pro Thermostat (#6353)

### Bugfixes
* When a device has a default wakeup interval of 0 (never wake up), this is now preserved during the interview, even when outside of the valid range advertised by the device (#6387)
* Added a compat flag to always set the time using `Time Parameters CC` as UTC, even if the device exposes way to set the timezone (#6388)

### Changes under the hood
* Lots of config file requirements from the style guide, especially regarding **Title Case** and **Sentence case** of strings, are now automatically enforced using ESLint (#6345)

## 12.0.4 (2023-10-09)
### Bugfixes
* Normalize result of `Controller.getAvailableFirmwareUpdates` to always include `channel` field (#6359)
* Fixed a crash that could happen while logging dropped sensor readings (#6379)
* Increased the range and default of the `response` timeout to accomodate slower 500 series controllers (#6378)

### Config file changes
* Treat Basic Set as events for TKB TZ35S/D and TZ55S/D (#6381)
* Add Zooz ZAC38 Range Extender (#6136)
* Corrected the label of the notification event `0x0a` to be `Emergency Alarm` (#6368)

## 12.0.3 (2023-10-05)
The `v12` release was supposed to increase reliability of Z-Wave JS, primarily by detecting situations where the controller was unable to transmit due to excessive RF noise or being unresponsive and automatically taking the necessary steps to recover.

Instead, it uncovered bugs and erratical behavior in the 500 series firmwares, which triggered the automatic recovery in situations where it was not necessary. In the worst case, this would cause Z-Wave JS to end up in an infinite loop or restart over and over.

This patch should fix and/or work around most (if not all) of these issues. Really sorry for the inconvenience!

### Bugfixes
* Fixed an infinite loop caused by assuming the controller was temporarily unable to transmit when when sending a command results in the transmit status `Fail` (#6361)
* Added a workaround to avoid a restart loop caused by 500 series controllers replying with invalid commands when assigning routes back to the controller (SUC) failed (#6370, #6372)
* Automatically recovering an unresponsive controller by restarting it or Z-Wave JS in case of a missing callback is now only done for `SendData` commands. Previously some commands which were expecting a specific command to be received from a node could also trigger this, even if that command was not technically a command callback. (#6373)
* Fixed an issue where rebuilding routes would throw an error because of calling the wrong method internally (#6362)

## 12.0.2 (2023-09-29)
### Bugfixes
* The workaround from `v12.0.0` for the `7.19.x` SDK bug was not working correctly when the command that caused the controller to get stuck could be retried. This has now been fixed. (#6343)

## 12.0.1 (2023-09-29)
### Bugfixes
* Ignore when a node reports `Security S0/S2 CC` to have version 0 (unsupported) although it is using that CC (#6333)

### Config file changes
* Add Shelly to manufacturers (#6339)
* Add Shelly Wave 1, Wave 2PM, update Wave 1PM association labels (#6326)
* Add Sunricher SR-ZV2833PAC (#6310)

### Changes under the hood
* Added an ESLint rule to help with deciding whether a config parameter needs to be `unsigned` or not (#6325, #6338)

## 12.0.0 (2023-09-26)
### Application compatibility
Home Assistant users who manage `zwave-js-server` themselves, **must** install the following upgrades before upgrading to this driver version:
* Home Assistant **2023.10.0** or higher
* `zwave-js-server` **1.32.0**

### Breaking changes · [Migration guide](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating-to-v12)
* Removed auto-disabling of soft-reset capability. If Z-Wave JS is no longer able to communicate with the controller after updating, please read [this issue](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/issues/6341) (#6256)
* Remove support for Node.js 14 and 16 (#6245)
* Subpath exports are now exposed using the `exports` field in `package.json` instead of `typesVersions` (#5839)
* The `"notification"` event now includes a reference to the endpoint that sent the notification (#6083)
* Keep separate Supervision session ID counters for each node (#6175)
* Validate the device fingerprint before installing firmware update instead of when checking for updates (#6192)
* Removed some deprecated methods (#6250)
* Managing SUC routes with the non-SUC method variants is no longer allowed (#6251)
* "Heal (network)" was renamed to "rebuild routes" to better reflect what it does (#6252)
* Corrected the argument type for `Driver.constructor`, `updateLogConfig` and `updateOptions` (#6254, #6319)

### Features
* Detect an unresponsive stick and reset it (#6244)
* The default time after which battery-powered devices with no pending commands are sent back to sleep is now `250 ms` (down from `1000ms`). This timeout is now configurable using the driver option `timeouts.sendToSleep`. This should result in significant battery savings for devices that frequently wake up. (#6312)

### Bugfixes
* A bug in the `7.19.x` SDK has surfaced where the controller gets stuck in the middle of a transmission. Previously this would go unnoticed because the failed commands would cause the nodes to be marked dead until the controller finally recovered. Since `v11.12.0` however, Z-Wave JS would consider the controller jammed and retry the last command indefinitely. This situation is now detected and Z-Wave JS attempts to recover by soft-resetting the controller when this happens. (#6296)
* Default to RF protection state `Unprotected` if not given for `Protection CC` V2+ (#6257)

* Use ESLint to enforce consistent property ordering in config parameters and avoid unnecessary `minValue/maxValue` (#6321, #6322)
* `yarn test` now only runs tests affected by changed files by default. This is also done on CI in PRs to speed up check times (#6274)
* Upgraded lots of dependencies (#6258)

## 11.14.3 (2023-09-21)
