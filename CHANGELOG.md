## 8.0.0-alpha.3 (2021-07-14) · _There is no spoon_
### Breaking changes · [Migration guide](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating-to-v8)
* User codes are no longer queried during the interview in order to save battery
* Restructured interview settings in `ZWaveOptions`
* Reworked how endpoints and lifeline associations are handled
* Removed `neighbors` property from `ZWaveNode` class and removed `InterviewStage.Neighbors`
* Added missing `node` argument to nodes' `"statistics updated"` event
* The minimum required Node.js version is now `v12.22.2`

## 7.0.0 (2021-03-23) · _Summer is coming!_
### Breaking changes · [Migration guide](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating-to-v7)
* Renamed `controller.removeNodeFromAllAssocations` to `controller.removeNodeFromAllAssociations` to fix a typo
* We've reworked/fixed the parsing of Node Information Frames (NIF) to match the specifications and changed node properties to make more sense
* Nodes with a completed interview are no longer queried for all their values when restarting
* The `deltaTime` and `previousValue` values for the `Meter CC` are no longer exposed
* Numeric loglevels are converted to the corresponding string loglevel internally. `driver.getLogConfig` always returns the string loglevel regardless.
* The `"notification"` event was decoupled from the `Notification CC` and now serves as a generic event for CC-specific notifications.

### Features
* The logger formats were more cleanly separated between logger and transport instances. As a result, writing user-defined transports is now much easier.
* Implemented a `logfmt` transport in https://github.com/zwave-js/log-transports
* Added support for `Entry Control CC`. It has been found that some entry control devices don't follow some of the strict rules regarding the data format. The validation can be turned off with the compat option `disableStrictEntryControlDataValidation`.
* Implemented an API to re-interview a single CC on a node and its endpoints without repeating the entire node interview
* The stack of `ZWaveError`s related to transmission errors now contain the call stack where the message was created instead of the internal state machine's stack
* Added a compat option `alarmMapping` to map unstandardized V1 alarm values to standardized V2 notification events
* Use the new compat option `alarmMapping` in Kwikset and Yale locks
* Moved the `deviceClass` property from `ZWaveNode` to its base class `Endpoint` and consider the endpoint's device class where necessary

### Bugfixes
* Changes to the logger configuration are now correctly applied dynamically
* Changed how an error gets identified as a `ZWaveError` to avoid problems with duplicated dependencies
* Writeonly parameters are no longer queried even if `Configuration CC` has version 3 or higher
* Fall back to slow refresh behavior on `Central Scene CC V2` if a delayed key up is detected
* Handle incorrectly zero-terminated strings in name reports of `Association Group Info CC`
* Allow healing single nodes
* Manually requesting a re-interview while another one is still in progress no longer causes multiple interviews to happen in parallel

## 6.0.0 (2021-01-19) · _This is the way_
### Breaking changes · [Migration guide](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating-to-v6)
* Logging can now be configured through driver options. However, the environment variables for logging are no longer evaluated lazily, so they now need to be set before requiring `zwave-js`.
* The second (string) parameter of the `"interview failed"` event handler was removed
* The type `ValueMetadataBase` has been renamed to `ValueMetadataAny`. The old type `ValueMetadataAny` was merged into `ValueMetadataBase`.
* The retry strategy for sending commands to nodes has been revised. By default, a message is no longer re-transmitted when the node has acknowledged its receipt, since it is unlikely that the retransmission will change anything. The old behavior can be restored by setting the `attempts.retryAfterTransmitReport` driver option to `true`.  
To compensate for the change and give the response enough time to reach the controller, the default for `timeouts.response` has been increased from `1600` to `10000`.
* The driver now distinguishes between stateful and event values. The latter are now exclusively exposed through the `"value notification"` event.
* The deprecated `nodeInterviewAttempts` option was removed
* The options `fs` and `cacheDir` have been renamed to `storage.driver` and `storage.cacheDir`.
* Loggers are now managed on a per-driver basis. This means you can use zwave-js to talk to different controllers and have separate logs for each.
* The `lookupXYZ` methods are no longer exposed by `@zwave-js/config`. Use the `configManager` property of your driver instance instead.

* Config json files are now automatically formatted in VSCode and linted
* While editing device config files, supporting IDEs can now use a JSON schema to help you
